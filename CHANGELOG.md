# Changelog

All notable changes to BareBear will be documented in this file.

## 0.2.1 (2026-04-29)

Packaging hygiene only. No code changes.

### Fixed

- The 0.2.0 sdist accidentally bundled unrelated repo content
  (large media files plus a leftover root `demo.gif`), inflating the
  source distribution. The wheel was always clean.
- Added explicit `[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]` include list so the
  sdist now contains only `src/`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`,
  and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Removed the leftover root `demo.gif`; the canonical asset lives at
  `assets/demo.gif`.

0.2.0 has been yanked. Use 0.2.1.

## 0.2.0 (2026-04-29)

Pivot release. BareBear is now positioned as the free agentic AI course —
a 12-lesson curriculum that uses the framework as its textbook. The primitives
are unchanged; the audience and the surface around them are.

### Added

- **`OllamaModel`** adapter for local Ollama servers (OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  at `http://localhost:11434/v1`). Default model: `qwen2.5:3b`.
- **`Task.system_prompt`** — first-class field for overriding the agent persona
  per task. Backwards compatible: when unset, the framework default applies.
- **`Bear.run(task, trace=True)`** — streams a learner-friendly narration of
  every loop turn to stdout (or a custom stream). For lesson notebooks and
  live debugging.
- **`Reflect`** helper — three small methods (`critique`, `revise`, `run`) for
  self-critique loops. Surfaces the reflection pattern as a named primitive.
- **`Bear.as_tool(name, description)`** — wraps a Bear so another Bear can call
  it as a Tool. Multi-agent in one line.
- **`lessons/`** — a 12-lesson curriculum: full Lesson 1 (notebook, Colab
  badge, written narrative) plus written narratives for lessons 2–12.
  Notebooks for 2–6 to follow; notebooks and scripts for 7–12 after that.
- **`docs/teaching/instructor-guide.md`** — classroom setup, per-lesson pacing,
  pitfalls, assessments, and 3-/6-/12-week curriculum subsets.
- **PyPI download badges** (pepy.tech, total + monthly) and GitHub stars badge
  in the README.
- `Topic :: Education` and `Intended Audience :: Education` PyPI classifiers.

### Changed

- **`MockModel` removed from the public API.** It now lives at
  `barebear.testing.FakeModel` and is used only by the framework's own tests.
  Lessons and examples always run against a real model.
- All examples now default to **OpenRouter** and accept
  `--provider {openrouter,ollama}`. The `--live` flag is gone — every run is
  live.
- README, manifesto, and quickstart rewritten for the educational positioning.
  Lead with the curriculum, the three-door first-60-seconds layout, the Colab
  badge for Lesson 1.
- Project description and keywords updated for educational discoverability.
- Unused `anthropic` optional dependency removed (no AnthropicModel ships).
- `docs/architecture.md` adapter table updated: `MockModel` and the planned
  `AnthropicModel` are gone; `OpenRouterModel`, `OllamaModel`, and the
  internal `barebear.testing.FakeModel` are in.

### Breaking

- `from barebear import MockModel` → `from barebear.testing import FakeModel`.
- Examples: `--live` flag replaced by `--provider {openrouter,ollama}`.
- `Task.to_dict()` now includes a `system_prompt` key (always present, may
  be `None`).

## 0.1.1 (2026-03-16)

### Added

- OpenRouter quickstart guide in docs
- OpenRouter model mentioned in README quickstart

### Changed

- New bear mascot logo
- README images now use release-safe absolute URLs so the PyPI project page renders correctly
- GitHub and PyPI package metadata are aligned on version `0.1.1`

## 0.1.0 (2026-03-15)

First public release.

### Added

- Core primitives: Bear, Task, State, Tool, Policy, Checkpoint, Report
- Model adapters: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Mock
- Policy-first tool execution with pre-call enforcement
- Budget tracking (steps, tool calls, tokens, cost)
- Checkpoint/approval system for high-risk actions
- Side-effect declarations on tools (`none`, `internal`, `external`)
- Run receipts with full step traces, assumptions, and uncertainties
- Honest uncertainty tracking with automatic extraction from model responses
- Tool schema introspection from Python type annotations
- Configurable timeouts on model adapters
- 4 runnable examples: research assistant, email approval, file patcher, ticket triage
- 86 passing tests, zero pyright strict-mode errors
